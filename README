This is the neuroimaging dataset for the The Brazilian High Risk Cohort Study for Childhood Psychiatric Disorders (BHRC)
of the INPD v0.8. BHRC is a large community school-based study that is following children from Brazil since 2010.
This study obtained psychological, genetic, and neuroimaging data with the aim to investigate typical and atypical trajectories 
of psychopathology and cognition over development. BHRC data collection was led by Brazil's National Institute of Developmental 
Psychiatry for Children and Adolescents (INCT-CNPq) and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul's Department of Psychiatry.

This version of the dataset was curated at the University of Pennsylvania by the Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center 
(PennLINC) as part of the "Reproducible Brain Chart" (RBC) Initiative. RBC seeks to aggregate, organize QA, process, curate, and 
openly disseminate many of the largest cross-sectional studies of brain development.
